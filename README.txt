Today you should work solo or in pairs to implement the following in the file linear_classifier.py, which has some utility built into it:

- Implement linear_classification_hard_threshold to have it do linear classification using stochastic gradient descent.
- Test your implementation on generated.csv, the data we saw in class. You should be able to achieve 92-94% accuracy after some number of epochs.
- Test your implementation on breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv, which is data from patients that may or may not have breast cancer. You should be able to get 96-98% accuracy after a large number of epochs (took mine about 10,000).
- Implement linear classification with logistic regression. This should be a lot of copy/paste from the previous implementation! Make sure you use a different accuracy measure based on mean squared error.
- Test your implementation on generated.csv and breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv.
